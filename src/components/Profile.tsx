            I am a Quality Engineer with 2 years of experience, primarily focused on the financial tech sector. My passion is ensuring the high-quality of Android and iOS applications. I specialize in end-to-end test automation using Java and Selenium (or Appium, little bit), and I've successfully driven the adoption of these tools. I am known for being a collaborative, proactive team member. I am now seeking a remote position where I can leverage my expertise in automation.
